# WMCleaner-ExtendedList
Static list for the [WMCleaner](https://koreanrandom.com/forum/topic/40734-) program of deleting files and folders that cannot be detected by analyzing the structure of the game. As a rule, these are objects at the root-folder of the game. The program can't  independently determine whether they are outsiders or not. For this, it needs this list.

### Using
The program accesses the list at start of **"Scan"**. You can disable the this by using option *"Settings - Download Extended List from GitHub"*. This option is checked by default.

### Updates
All interested users can supplement it. To do this, create a issue in this repository and specify what you want me to add to the list.
