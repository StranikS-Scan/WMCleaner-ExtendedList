# WMCleaner-ExtendedList
Static list of deleting files and folders that cannot be detected by analyzing the structure of the game. As a rule, these are objects at the root of the game. The program can not determine whether they are outsiders or not. For this, it needs this list.

### Using
The program accesses the list at start of **"Scan"**. You can disable the download list option *"Settings - Download Extended List from GitHub"*. The option is **"On"** by default.

### Updates
All interested users can supplement it.
